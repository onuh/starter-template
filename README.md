Starter template for pages navigation in framework7

Navigate between all html pages you create smoothly without page refresh. Also works with back button. Note that all your js and css files must be included in index.html
Edit the routes.js to add aditional routes then create the html pages. Note that the pages won't work except you use the class="page" declaration in the enclosing div.
Run this template from a server such as xampp or apache cordova node server for it to work. Use your prefered CSS library and other Javascript Library only in index.html
Enjoy!!!
